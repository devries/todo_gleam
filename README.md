# TODO list

This is a todo list program written with a server in Gleam and HTMX on the
frontend in order to get a better understanding how Gleam and HTMX can work
together. Todo items are saved to a sqlite database.

This is based on my [Go implementation](https://github.com/devries/todo) of
the same thing.
