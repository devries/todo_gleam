# TODO list

This is a todo list program written with a server in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) on the
frontend in order to get a better understanding how Gleam and HTMX can work
together. Todo items are saved to a [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database.
I use the [wisp](https://gleam-wisp.github.io/wisp/) web framework and the
[Lustre](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/index.html) library to generate HTML. 

I also decided to use this as a test implementation for trying
[tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Litestream](https://litestream.io/).
It also does snapshot testing with [Birdie](https://hexdocs.pm/birdie/).

This is based on my [Go implementation](https://github.com/devries/todo) of
the same thing.

I'll just call this the Gleam Wisp Htmx Erlang Lustre Tailscale (GWHELT) stack.
